,,Advisor,2022-08-15 10:23:27.000,"Thanks for the information. Other than your phone, are you seeing the correct album art in iTunes? Do you use either Apple Music or iTunes Match service? Are you missing any music now that your phone sync’d with your computer?"
,,Customer,2022-08-16 07:30:44.000,It shows correct on iTunes on computer but not phone. I lost some playlists that were on my phone but not computer
,,Advisor,2022-08-16 07:30:44.000,"To confirm, do you sync your iPhone with iTunes on your computer in order to get your music onto your phone? Or do you also have Apple Music or iTunes Match?"
,,Customer,2022-08-16 08:31:27.000,I uploaded a cd I bought to iTunes and I was wanted to put that on my phone so I hooked up my phone to transfer.
,,Advisor,2022-08-16 08:31:27.000,"Okay. Have you tried re-syncing any of the music with incorrect album artwork? If not, let’s try that next. "
,,Customer,2022-08-16 09:17:38.000,I did connect it more than once. I’m afraid to connect it again. I read it is an iPhone 13 glitch but I don’t know
,,Advisor,2022-08-16 09:17:38.000,"To clarify, other than connecting the iPhone did you try syncing using the steps outlined here: https://s.apple.com/dE0n2U4M9Y 
If not, try resyncing and let us know the results. We understand your reservations but can assure you this is an important step to help work towards a resolution. "
