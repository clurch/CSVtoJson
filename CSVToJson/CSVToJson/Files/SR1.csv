,,Customer,2022-08-16 07:15:00.000,"Hello, hope you’re doing well! I’m getting a new iphone today and I want to make a new apple ID for it. However, I was wondering if it’s possible for someone who has my phone number in their contacts list to see the new apple ID address (associated with my phone number) as well as my full name? Also, if I have their number blocked, would that affect this in any way?"
,,Advisor,2022-08-16 07:16:00.000,"Hello there, thanks for reaching out about your new iPhone! Congratulations on that! We’re excited to help out. 
To start, we want to make sure we’re on the same page. Are you referring to sharing your photo and name using the Messages app? If so, this managed in Settings > Messages > Share Name and Photo. If enabled, this shares your name and photo that has been added to your account, once they update your contact card on their side. If disabled, it would not share this information. 
Were you having a specific issue with this feature? If so, tell us more and we’ll take it from there."

I mean when my contacts change their memoji or change their name on their apple ID my iMessage always suggests that I can update their contact info or change their name in my contacts list etc. automatically. So I was wondering if the same thing would happen if I make a new apple ID for myself but have the same old phone number associated with it as I do on my old apple ID.
Would people on my blocked contacts/numbers get those suggestions regarding my number name apple ID email etc.? Or would my contact information just stay the same on their iphones since I have them blocked on iMessage and FaceTime?"
,,Advisor,2022-08-16 08:50:00.000,"Blocked contacts would not see those suggestions. Current contacts may not see those suggestion either if the update is changing to a new Apple ID. If you are making a new Apple ID, please be aware that purchases and app downloads are connected with the Apple ID used to download those. Creating a new Apple ID will mean you lose access to that content. If you want to change the email associate with your Apple ID, see how here: https://s.apple.com/dE4i8T6z4t "

,,Customer,2022-08-16 13:02:00.000,"Hi again! One more thing, I just set up my new iPhone 13 and it’s having trouble connecting to FaceTime and iMessage with my phone number. It’s either saying “waiting for activation” or that there’s an error and activation failed. The same thing has been happening on my iPhone Xr for a couple days now and no matter what I do it just doesn’t work. Could this be a problem with my provider? Or is there anything else I can do other than restarting the phone and turning FaceTime/iMessage off and then on again?"
